# Summary
In the introduction I introuce the topic of AI use in the field of artwork.  From animation to just general images, the use of AI has seen a giant uptick in the past couple years.
I dive into the argument that AI is making artwork trend toward unoriginallity and just lacks creativity in general. 

<p>After creating the entirity of my video I really enjoyed the process.  I first created my script and tried to mentally picture how the video wouldd peice together but after recording my audio I then went in and added visual effects to enhance it.  When talking about AI art I tried to keep a balance of ssupporting facts and description.  after doing my intro I was worried the rest of my video would just have to be supporting souces but after doing research I found further points, such as low treatment of AI artwork workers that further helped create my argument. </p>
I don't think I did a typical video essay because I didn't record my face at all.  When I began I didn't realize how much harder I was making it for myself. I now realize that people most likely do that for filler content and aas a result I had to find/create more images to fill in the blank spaces. 

I used two big sources, an article by Matt Corall and a youtube video where Trevor Paglen discussed AI.  Both these sources really helped me unnderstand the viewpoint from an artists percepective.  They describe how AI art is effecting their own lives and the general populaatiosn lives.
